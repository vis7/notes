Lambda
AWS Lambda is serverless compute service, meaning the developers don't have to worry about which aws resources to launch, or how they will manage them, they just put the code in lambda and it just runs. It's that simple! Although Lambda can only be used to execute background tasks.



# Layers
## Why ?
More organized deployment package
Allow lambda function inline editing (if our package is more than 3 MB we are not allowed to do inline editing)
Enable library sharing between lambda functions

# todo 
+ share layer by two lambda functions
