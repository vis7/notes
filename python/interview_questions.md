# Practicals
```
nums = [1, 9, 4, 12, 20, 2, 8, 21, 3] 
# output = : 1, 4, 2, 3, 

nums = [36, 60, 32, 70, 35, 63, 34, 33] 
# output : 36 32 35 34 33 
```

```
#Get the longest starting string match in the list. 

nums = [“flower”, “flow”, “flight”] 
# output = “fl” 
```

```
# Let us know the output: 

squares = [] 
for x in range(50): 
    squares.append(lambda: x**3) 

print(squares[25]()) 
print(squares[5]())
```
