import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# for reading csv file
df = pd.read_csv("my_csvfile.csv")

# for getting first five record
df.head()

# can access attribute of dataframe
df.columns
df.index
df.<column_name>

# for creating series you can pass list, tuple, numpy array or dicionary for creating series
s = pd.Series(data)

# boolean indexing
s = pd.Series([1,2,3,4,5])
s > 3 # will give series with True and False value

# you can access values of series from True/False boolean indexing
s[s > 3]

# can access and change value of series



# when doing series addtion only matching index value will be added and other values will become NaN
