Djongo is the only connector that lets you use Django with MongoDB without changing the Django ORM. Under the hood, Djongo translates SQL queries generated by Django into MongoDB queries – that’s how it manages to preserve the ORM.


MongoEngine is a Python Object-Document Mapper for working with MongoDB. It’s very similar to Django’s ORM (in fact, even its API has a lot of resemblances) but for a document-oriented database (hence the name ODM)
